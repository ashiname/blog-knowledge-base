    <h1>Post 1</h1>
    <p>I play Minecraft in a modpack (a collection of mods community made) called All The Mods 9 and I've been experiencing so much game crashes lately and that is so annoying.</p>
    <p>
        it's crazy because I'm not even pushing the game that far considering this pack holds four hundred mods at the same time.
        I've already played like almost 150 hours and basically I can't remember that being so frequent
        the first time it happened it was right after I opened a shaders pack (a pack of textures and lights). crazy thing it was not even a heavy pack really, it was not even stressing my processor even a little bit more than the usual. but apparently it was the beginning of a thing much more frequent in the future.

        as I am writing this text, I used a gadget called copy and paste gadget and I don't know what I exactly I messed up this much because in the past it worked very well, even copying machines from other mods. but now that I have copied a car made only off vanilla blocks it fucking crashed all my save with no chance of recovering. I really don't know what happened
