            <p>This is the movie that made me reflect on how I saw death as an extraordinary event, when
                sometimes it can be something really mundane, something that happens out of blue, like sleeping one day
                and never waking up, or a sudden fatal accident. Tomorrow we can really no longer be here.</p>

            <p>Recently I be having some near death experience flashs, mainly while on street. Like this one time when I
                was close to home, but walking on street instead of on the sidewalk, then a car that was going the
                opposite way for some reason had to make a sudden right turn, maybe to avoid hitting something, in this
                moment things flashed on my mind... Like it wasn't even this fast, but one's life can end as sudden as
                that.</p>

            <p>On another day I was crossing the street to the other side and then suddenly a car came to my way and for
                a split second I was frozen in place. That moment I really thought "my life could've ended here", but
                the car made a successful left turn and continued on the street. It's like everytime you walk on the
                streets you have a real chance of being killed by some psycho driving. Like, REALLY die.</p>
            <p>I can't say for sure that I noticed these situations before thinking really hard about this movie, but I
                can't really remember having these thoughts before, even though I am "The 20 year old walker" who just
                walks around the city all day as a pastime. In fact I thought so hard about this movie that I rewatched
                it before committing to writing about it. I wasn't feeling too confident about writing about it because
                some time had already passed since I watched it and when I sat down and tried to my head got empty.</p>

            <div class="center-img"><img src="https://i.redd.it/gepyslyfrlv81.jpg" alt="" width="600px" style="border: 2px solid lightgray;"></div>

            <p>Since the moment I told a friend of mine about this movie I started to want to rewatch it, because I
                wanted to write about it and above all because I think that it can really transform the way you think
                about life.</p>
            <p>Not every time death will announce it's own arrival, you can either have a fatal accident or simply sleep
                one day and don't wake up anymore. And death will ever be a taboo when you are young. I feel that what's
                this movie told me about was that we always expect the death to be a whole process, and several times it
                isn't. The death causes we are most used to in everyday life is: by illness, aging or suicide. Either
                illness and aging is a process, except when it's a sudden health worsening that causes a fast death. But most
                accidents no one is waiting to lose someone, most people wouldn't imagine their loved ones to go out in
                the city and suddenly being involved in a truck crash and die, as the movie shows.</p>

            <p>That boy lending his motorbike to his sister, only for her to die all of a sudden, or the girl from the
                first story who died run over by a truck going to the convenience store to buy more beer. This type of
                death cause can leave a heartbreaking feeling of "what if she didn't went there that day?" I imagine...
                I can't really imagine how would it be having to deal with such a feeling, having someone I love dying
                like this.</p>

            <p>I can't lie that I am STILL reflecting on the meanings of this movie and what things it can still tell
                me. It was hard to even begin writing about it because death is such a complicated matter, and I luckily
                didn't had to deal with it happening near me yet, though thinking that this will inevitably happen one
                day is frightening, I hope that this will be so much later than sooner.</p>

            <p>Death will always be something that humans will struggle to deal being a conscious being, and I think
                that waking us up for the fact that it can happen out of the ordinary tomorrow is actually a good thing
                this movie do! It can sound too "peace and love" and kind of a bullshit idealization (at least it kind
                of sounds to me) but maybe having that in mind people could argue less with each other. Maybe we could
                fight less, maybe we could learn not to sleep mad at each other, not to fight and abandon people. We all
                will only be here for a brief moment and then we will cease to exist.</p>
            <p>But what I'm more afraid is not of dying, although it would be highly unpleasant, it wouldn't make that
                much of a difference, I wouldn't know anymore what's like not to be alive or dead, but what I'm more
                afraid is losing someone I love, and that's why I'm saying that, above of all, we must try not fight and
                be mean as less as we can, because we don't know when it's someone's time to die tomorrow.</p>

            <p>We must not be arrogant, in this life we're an extra, we're not special, we all are temporary.</p>
            <p>Now, taking accountability, this is something I admit I have to learn. Not because you think you know
                more about something than someone else it means they're worse in any other way, people just have
                different interests and different ways of exploring those interests, and above it all, in the end people
                are simple. <br>
                Most people have simpler minds than they think, that's most probably the case even to me.
                Arrogance is never the answer, even towards arrogant people, you should not fight fire with fire,
                arrogance is just a childish feeling of wanting to be special, you should not be mean with no one, even
                when they are behaving like this with you.</p>

            <p>Maybe having in mind that anyone, no matter how slightly, have the chance to die tomorrow, you are more
                prone to let things go and be kinder so you can enjoy your life and the life of the ones that surround
                you because we are all temporary here, no one comes to this life to stay, tomorrow may be your time to
                go.</p>
