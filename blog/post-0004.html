            <p> 21:32</p>
            <p>I always pass through some process of hiatus but it's so frequent that it really bothers me.</p>
            <p>I try to not give too much "meaning" to things that don't really "matter" like watching movies or listening to
                music but sometimes it can get really hard to not quantify the things you interact with because the platforms
                kind of make significant effort for you to apply pressure on yourself to use their products.</p>
            <p>I mean it's cool that you create a platform for knowing how many movies you have already watched because I don't
                know... you canuse it to get new recommendations and watch similar things you have already liked before, but
                when the app shows how many movies I watched this year, I feel kind of pressured to watch more movies. and you
                have to consider that being able to see how many movies some of your followers watched this year can
                significantly "motivates" you to watch more movies too.</p>
            <p>I mean I can't say how exactly Letterboxd personally would benefit that much from it, and I don't mean to say
                that they are opportunists. but the tech companies are working to shape the behavior of the people for a long
                time now. it's like kind of a bigger system. </p>
            <p>as Variety publishes in September 29, 2023: Letterboxd Acquired by Canadian Firm in Deal Valuing It at More Than
                $50 Million.</p>
            <p>$50 million dolars is an undeniable huge amount of money. With stablish directors such as Martin Scorsese or
                other celebrities creating their accounts on the site, it's not an understatement to say that Letterboxd is
                today a tool of the cinema industry. At least I didn't noticed any significant downgrade on the site's usability
                since it sold 60% of it's value to a canadian company called Tiny, a company of "company buyers", who apparently
                have the culture of letting the companies they buy "Do their own thing".</p>
            <p>I think when last.fm shows the number of "scrobbles" you have, this doesn't motivate you to explore new music,
                but apply some kind of pressure on you. and the site even shows you which one of your followers in you have
                listened to more music every week month or year.</p>
            <p>I think that differently from Letterboxd, Last.fm is actually way more user oriented than Letterboxd, that is way
                more "peer presure oriented", take that just by both of the site's home pages. </p>
            <p>Last.fm shows your recommendations as the main page, while Letterboxd shows what your friends watched recently
                and what people are watching and commenting on films in general</p>
            <p>I think is natural because each one of them seems to have a specific goal in mind, and it's somehow kind of
                clear. Last.fm aims to register your listenings, and Letterboxd aims to be a social network around films. But
                both of them kind of gets me pressure to "watch" more on it's own way... </p>
            <p>I think it was supposed to be pretty normal that you're interests every now and then shifts and you kind of give
                a break to listening to music or watching movies. but I feel kind of pressured because of that culture of
                keeping up... with everyone else maybe?</p>
            <p>it's kind of like the same pressure Instagram do on its users, something like: look your friends are doing things
                and you are not! even though it would be normal for you to live your particular life doing your
                particular activities.</p>
            <p>I always do "hiatuses" because... I don't know... I'm not the kind of the most skilled with multitasking.</p>
            <p>In two different moments this year that I started working again I kind of dropped everything... or like, didn't
                even remembered of it for a long time or managed to do it. And that goes for a lot of activities like playing
                games, watching movies, studying. I kind of move on on the subject and momentarily forget about other stuff...
            </p>
            <p>And the problem is I feel bad for it. Every time I be feeling like I wanted to have never stopped. Sometimes even
                thinking things like: If I had never stopped, by now I would have watched 2 times the amount of movies I
                watched, and that's partly what I commented at the beginning about "try to not give too much meaning too things
                that don't really "matter"".</p>
            <p>There was a time that I was talking to a friend about movies, and I was watching so many movies at the time, but
                we've gone a way that I concluded that I needed not to watch more, but to make it a more significant activity.
                Not to watch more, but to do it with more quality and purpose. That was when I stopped, almost all of a sudden.
                I decided I don't needed to watch mindlessly watch a ton of movies, but to do a lot less if needed, and to write
                about it more often, that conversation was when my mind definitely changed, and this blog reflects a lot of that
                need to write more to give more meaning, to be more thoughtful throughout the process.</p>
            <p>I was kind of forced to accept that things I haven't done in the past cannot be done now. Because like... the
                past is gone! theres no more way to go back there and do things you didn't done. And with those hiatuses being
                so frequent, at some point it was a matter of getting used to or going insane about it.</p>
            <p>I admit that I haven't gotten over it yet, that's why I'm writing this. Is a way of expressing my frustration and
                to CREATE something with a thing that don't actually have one single good aspect. The way my mind uses get over
                quantity, when I can't do more than I did in the past anymore, is at least "winning" by QUALITY instead. It's
                kind of this: Since we can't do anymore what we haven't done in the past, we will things BETTER instead. </p>
