            <h1 style="text-align: center;">I don't read books</h1>
<p>            I don't read books, regular books, those ones that just have text and that it is. </p>
<p>If I would say this don't really have a reason, I just... established the things I liked back in my teenager years and never looked back at books.</p>

<p>Which is something mildly curious because I'm a huuuge huge fan of mangas.</p>

    To be honest, I'm kind of prone to avoid having contact with books that just shows text on it. Like come on we must admit it's a lot more boring and uncool than comics (I hope just for someone who is not used to it).
    To read regular books I must admit I kind of just scratched the idea every time I think about it.
</p>

<h2>My brief trajectory</h2>

<p>As a non-native english speaker, one of the first ideas I had to improve my understanding sounded like genius work. I thought to myself: If I must learn a new way of communicating let's think about how native speakers actually have their first contacts with their own language, let's read a child's book!!</p>
<p>And then I search in Google something like english child books or something and came in contact with the book that would chase me to this very day: Charlotte's Web!</p>

<div class="center-img"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81KlKElAxHL._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg" alt="" height="500px"></div>

<p>This books is almost like a close relative to me just for how much time he is together with me, and the crazy part is that I never actually finished it! Strange enough? Now that I think about it, yeah I think it is.</p>
<p>As Charlotte's Web was my pick for getting used with the english vocabulary, I took so long to sit down and read it that I actually learned the entire language to a point I can write long texts, speak and read fluently and I still didn't finished it.</p>
<p>To be honest, no matter how many times I tried and put in my mind I would compensate for learning english before reading it, I never got past the page 15.</p>

<p>Not to be unfair and say I never, NEVER really read anything, I actually finished 2 books.</p>

<p>The two others were Sun Tzu's 'Art of War' and Homer's 'Odyssey', but both of them was audiobook versions.</p>

<div class="center-img"><img src="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9780465013272-1.jpg" alt="" height="400px"> <img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1728/pg1728.cover.medium.jpg" alt="" height="400px"></div>

<p>Both of these books I heard in a time where I thou+ght my bicycle was about to die, like sooner or later, so in an act of protest I decided that I was going to walk all the way to work and home everyday.</p>
<p>The first few days I heard to music all the way to the work 7 AM, but as I worked 40 min by foot from work, it rapidly got very boring and I was getting tired of listening to so much music, so I had the idea of listen to books instead!</p>

<p>I don't remember which one I read first, but I would say it was a good experience overall. In reality, for the Odyssey's case I would say it was an experience better than the normal. The video I was watching was so well made, like, they added all sorts of sound effects, ocean waves, they made different voices for each character, it was like so epic of an experience, worthy of a truly Greek epic myth, it was way more epic than a regular book reading experience could ever be.</p>

<p>For Art of War's case I think the audiobook didn't made that much of a difference, given it's kind of a "war instruction manual" if I could say. I wouldn't lie, I read it because the liberals keep bragging about it's utility in the normal life, and I kiiiind of will not say they're completely wrong. At that work we had a guy who was a ``f***ing loser as our department leader``, like he didn't fit that role, but he was inevitably in charge because he was the person who was at the company for the most time. I wouldn't lie that GIVEN my context I found some "tips" to be kind of useful to keep in mind, I remember I was thinking it could be somehow useful if he read or knew some hot takes the book gave, but if we talk about completely changing your life's trajectory? nah...</p>

<p>By all of that anyone can agree that my contact with books is basically nonexistent, only one amateur book, one audiobook and the rest of all my reading history is only japanese manga, but I will change that!</p>

<h2>The next steps</h2>

<p>Talking about the next steps, first of all my intention in writing this post was exactly to be a milestone to me reading trajectory.</p>
<p>I DO want to read "regular" books, and I even have my wishlist already, but SOMEHOW I can't bring myself to "start" it!!! I want to finish Charlotte's Web, kind of just to make up for the fact I was too lazy to read it. Right in front of me in my desk I have 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone', borrowed from my boyfriend, and I do mean to read it, more sooner than later, not for nothing I put it in my desk.</p>
<p>I want to read some national literacture, as I'm a brazilian in reality, I want so much to read some Machado de Assis' works, like Dom Casmurro, O Cortiço, and other renowned authors. I already plan to read Don Quixote too, a spanish novel, and may this be an opportunity to write here in spanish, and in portuguese too with those brazilian novels.</p>
<p>Wait for it in the next chapters of this blog.</p>
