            <h1 style="text-align: center;">The week was crap and I can't multitask</h1>

            <p>And again I’m passing through the same experience I’ve run through some months ago. It’s way too hard for
                me to multitask.</p>

            <p>May to June this year (2025) I worked at a place and it was such an excruciating experience that I simply
                stopped doing anything else I liked, even in my free time from work.</p>

            <p>Then I was unemployed again, and only then I realized how I basically died for my own life on that 3
                months period. All the time I was at that job, I didn't do the things I enjoyed, and I couldn't pay
                attetion to things I wanted to do next</p>

            <p>Been laid off of that job I was unemployd for about a week or so, then I got another job, but this time
                it was a part time job at a store. So for the short period I was in there (1,5 month) this kind of
                didn't happened again.</p>
            <p>As it was a position at a store, whenever there wasn't any customers I was free to listen to music, read,
                or anything else.</p>

            <p>More recently, the current time I'm writing this, again I started working on another full time job, and
                as I was experiencing that feeling of abandoning myself, and being experienced in the matter, it made me
                do the active experiment that was saying like: "— Okay now I'm gonna stop what I'm doing a little and
                Imma try to think about my own life.". But kind of... I don't know how to explain but I simply couldn't.
            </p>
            <p>I'm in kind of a leading position, so this problem seems to become even worse because I have to pay
                attention in how other people are working, so I don't know if I get kind of worried by how the things
                are working out, but when I tried to sit down a little and grab my phone to write some diary or analyze
                something I had to do next, my head was just... empty. It's as a bizarre feeling that is very confusing
                to explain.</p>

            <p>As I explained before in a previous post, I hate to "go hiatus". So because of that, and realizing I
                cannot work full time while paying attention that I still exist and want to do things beside of working,
                I created a Google Sheets specifically to put things I watched, listened to and read to remember when
                was the last time I did those things I liked. But EVEN that way I AM STILL NOT ABLE to keep up with
                things I like the same time I get a "full working week".</p>

            <p>To me it's very obvious it would work, it accounts the last time I read, watched a movie or listened to
                an album, three things I like to do. But even having this active reminder... I can't.</p>

            <p>Worst thing is I CAN see the reason.</p>
            <p>While at work site most of the times I can't stop and think about other stuff outside from it, but when I
                come home I have free time, but I waste it. I watch Youtube videos I don't even like anymore or care,
                but I'm too used to, and scroll Twitter, and by doing that... the time just flies by right in front of
                my face.</p>

            <p>Life is like this. When you least expect it's been an entire year and you didn't even noticed... Even
                setting up a lot of reminders I couldn't yet ease this feeling. This has been the most significant
                feeling when it comes to review that I didn't do something I was meaning to. "The times just flew by, I
                don't- I- I don't know what happened, the time just flies and I couldn't do it" it's the exact 100% way
                of how this is addressed in my head </p>

            <p>I'm tired of this feeling. At work I cannot think, while I'm using my computer I cannot think too because
                of too many distractions.</p>

            <p>That working is this bullshit where you lose the rest of your entire life I think everybody who ever
                worked already knew. But I think I may be possibly making it even worse, maybe because I don't make
                enough effort to take my mind off of work a little, or because when I have the free time to to the said
                things I waste it with other time consuming bullshit.</p>

            <p>And at the end of the day I don't even know how to conclude this text. Normally I would finish with kind
                of anticipating the next episodes, but I don't know... I do hope this can change, but I needed to be an
                active voice in my own life, I needed to take part at every hour and do everything I do with intention,
                and I do want to do it, that was exactly the reason I created a blog...</p>

            <p>Let's hope that writing things and the other things I bothered to write and express here can be a spark
                that says I AM able to change my life for better.</p>
