        <h1>Review of It's a Summer Film (2020)</h1>
        <p>As a high school days movie this movie remembers me a long gone feeling I had back in those days: that burning passion and will to make things happen.</p>
        <p>I always have had this desire of doing my own things and maybe always will, no coincidence I am here now making my own texts, soooo somehow, at least for the moment we can say I made it! I'm expressing my feelings and personality.</p>

        <p>I've (maybe) always had one specific problem that is: I liked things but I didn't knew what to do with it. In some moments this was so insane I'd be thinking "What's the point of wanting to do something this bad if you barely have anything to say?".</p>
        <p>It's almost as It's A Summer Film! did what we couldn't do at that age! Barefoot, Kickboard and Blue Hawaii gets together and decide they're going to make a samurai movie, following Barefoot's love for samurai cinema. </p>

        <p>To ACTUALLY make things happen, as usual in teenager japanese media, they decide they are going to work part time to buy equipments to make their movie. They manage to get the help from a guy called Rintaro, who Barefoot found earlier going to the cinema. He accepts helping they earning funds for the movie but refuse to participate at first.</p>
        
        <p>A lot of times in my high school days, me and my friends had to make some art piece, considering we took some art related classes at our school, but often I'd realize that the result was not decent enough, in reality, in a lot of other contexts and school homeworks I'd be the boring guy who wanted to do things better, I was kinda of always a perfectionist, but that kind of gets in  your way everytime if you let.</p>
        <p>So, doing what they can, they buy a tripod for Kickboard's iPhone, a microphone, a boom pole and get 2 guys from their classes to operate it. It's like the soul of the hand made independent production, and that sparks something in me that screams I NEED TO EXPRESS MYSELF.</p>
